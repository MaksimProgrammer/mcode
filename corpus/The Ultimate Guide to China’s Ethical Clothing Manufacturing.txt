Thanks to the insanely low costs in developing countries and the rise of fast fashions, the world is 
getting addicted to cheap, crappy clothes from brands that outsource the manufacturing at rock 
bottom prices. Over the decades, clothes have evolved from valuable possessions to seasonable 
disposable items. Fast fashion brands like H & M, Zara, Forever 21are leading the way to set new 
lows for the fashion industry with their business model of producing inexpensive, trendy clothes 
that buyers would only wear a few times. To share a slice of the pie retailers like Walmart also enroll 
in the game to meet up with customers’ expectations. The never ending cycle of fast fashion 
consumption is disastrous to human beings and the planet in the long run.
Over the past couple of years, I’ve written extensively about the clothes industry in China. And I’ve 
found out that the local government and some China clothes manufacturers are fighting back to 
produce clothes in a more ethical, sustainable way. I’ve also received many inquiries from fashion 
brands that want to bring their clothing lines to a new level but a bit anxious about rising of prices. 
Shopping ethically has been considered as more expensive because the price points of ethical brands 
far exceed the ones of fast fashions. It does cost more to produce clothes in an ethical way. Ethical 
manufacturing involves paying workers more, using premium quality recyclable materials and make 
sure that the complete process of manufacturing is environmental friendly. For consumers shopping 
from ethical brands means being able to train themselves to buy more sustainable, long lasting 
clothes than cheap, throwaway ones. The good news is there’re more and more Chinese clothing 
factories shifting more on ethical, sustainable manufacturing, stimulated by the local government’s 
stringent environmental crackdown on manufacturers. That’s why we’ve looked into ethical 
manufacturing in China and put this guide together.

# What’s ethical clothing manufacturing?
Ethical clothing manufacturing is a sustainable and ethical approach to clothes production process 
that focuses on the best interests of all involved. An ethical clothing manufacturer cares about every 
part of the supply chain, the best interests of workers, whether they’re treated well, balance of 
working hours, allowances, high quality recyclable materials and manufacturing with minimum 
wastes as well as energy consumption.
There’re three factors:
* Ethical manufacturing practices: An ethical clothing manufacturer enforces regulations of the best 
interests of their workers, clean, safe facility, fair wages, allowances, balanced working hours, 
setting up programs to aid workers in need, giving back to the community, etc. 
* Ethical raw materials: An ethical clothing supplier produces clothes from natural, recyclable 
materials without any harmful contaminants or effects. When you buy clothes from ethical brands, 
you can be sure it’s safe for your family as it’s strictly tested.
* Ethical energy: Ethical businesses usually go far and beyond to explore alternative technologies 
to minimize waste and emissions. The production is carried out in an environmental friendly 
approach.
# Why should you go with ethical clothing manufacturing?
* Fast fashion’s the second biggest source of pollution. Many fast fashion brands produce cheap, 
throwaway clothes that are designed to wear several times, while others use non-recyclable 
petroleum-based fabrics and accessories that wouldn’t biodegrade for centuries. A severe issue fast 
fashion creates is the sheer amount of waste that fail to handle properly. According to a McKinsey 
report, three-fifths of garments end up in incinerators or landfills. It’s time to put the brakes on fast 
fashion. Worse, to get rock bottom prices some brands outsource manufacturing to sweatshops that 
treat the workers badly or employ child labor. 
* Growing awareness of ethical fashion. As with organic food/vegan food, consumers have become 
more aware of what happened to the clothes they wear, who made them, do they contain any 
dangerous chemicals, are there any environmental damages, what about the working conditions of 
the workers, etc. A more holistic approach has been formed regarding workmanship, ethnics, 
environmental and humanitarian concerns of the clothes. It’s a trend more and more consumers 
would choose to stand on ethical fashion.
* Branding benefits. One of the greatest benefits of ethical clothing manufacturing is branding 
benefits. Developing, manufacturing and distributing cloths in a way that represents the planet and 
its inhabitants is a sure way to build up a good brand image and stay away from negative press or 
unethical manufacturing practices.
# China’s environmental crackdown on manufacturers
Since 2014 the Chinese premier Li Keqiang’s declaration of war against pollution especially 
industrial pollution, stringent regulations and rules have been put into practice to monitor, prevent 
and reduce pollution. China’s massive crackdown of industrial pollution is driving thousands of 
factories out of business while creating huge opportunities for ethical, sustainable manufacturers.
